This is the first iteration of the boy band website. The name originated during a borrel in a discussion between two German students, Sir Tim Wehnes and Lady Pia Moznodowsky. The name was accepted without objections by the members of the whatsapp group formely known as "Drinks" and became commonly known as the group's name quickly thereafter.&nbsp; &nbsp;
