  <h2 id="name">Origin</h2>
<p>This name originated during a borrel in a discussion between two German students, Sir Tim Weyhnes and Lady Pia Moznodowsky. The name was accepted without objections by the members of the whatsapp group formerly known as "Drinks". However, some sources suggest that the name's origin was a long time before that borrel and it was used by external parties to refer to the group. This is highly disputed because it makes us look bad.</p></section>
<section><h2 id="location">Location</h2>
<p>All the members are students of Vrije Universitiet, Amsterdam and are a part of the Gyrinus study association. The borrels of the study association are held at De Tegenstelling (WN-D103) at the VU campus. La Chouffe is the drink of choice, followed closely by Water.</p></section>
